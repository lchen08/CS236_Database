# CS236 Database Management Systems
The files uploaded are some of the deliverables I had created for the mini projects that I have completed for CS236 Database Management Systems at UC Riverside. 

The instructions for the assignment can be found in the 'CS236 Class Project.pdf' file, including where to download the dataset. The Report.pdf (was originally the README file referenced in the instructions document) details the outputs generated by the code found in DBRunner.java. In summary, the program implements algorithms used to perform some of the basic database functions typically used when handling data in databases such as group, sorts, and union (more listed in the report).
